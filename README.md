Developing-Data-Products

This repository has the ui.R and server.R files for the first part of the Developing Data Products Course Project.  First, we need to create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, we should use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about the application.

Welcome to the "Analysis of Car Features" app, that was developed for the Developing Data Products Course, from Coursera. This app helps in building the relationship between various car features with respect to miles per gallon (MPG), using the mtcars dataset from [R].Displacement and Gross Horsepower can be selected by using slider, Other variables can be selected and relationship is shown with respect to mpg.

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available on the GitHub.

The app developed for the first part of the assignment is avalilable at: https://prabeeti.shinyapps.io/DevelopingDataProducts_Week4Project/

The presentation is available at: http://rpubs.com/prabeeti/558006

Files for the presentation are avalilable on the GitHub: https://github.com/prabeeti/Developing-Data-Products
